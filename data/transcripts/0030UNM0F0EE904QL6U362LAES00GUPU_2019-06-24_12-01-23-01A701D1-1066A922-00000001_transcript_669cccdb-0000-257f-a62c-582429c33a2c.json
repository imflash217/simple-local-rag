anything like that and has been closed out so that I really don't have any more information um but it looks like everything is fine as far as that goes\n\n<AGENT ts_1039.84_a>:  um it wasn't recently if it was open um by him it was quite a while ago but apparently it just timed out with a nine balance\n\n<AGENT ts_1113.4_a>: and let me just ask you to confirm his date of birth if you don't mind

contributing account that are different but they're\n\n<AGENT ts_1147.53_a>:  um\n\n<AGENT ts_1155.56_a>:  they're both available under that same plan also sometimes it has to do with the plan being upgraded\n\n<AGENT ts_1159.04_a>:  so it would be in that scope\n\n<AGENT ts_1161.9_a>:  sometimes yeah\n\n<AGENT ts_1171.95_a>:  for the employer plan you mean\n\n<AGENT ts_1187.31_a>: okay well it
