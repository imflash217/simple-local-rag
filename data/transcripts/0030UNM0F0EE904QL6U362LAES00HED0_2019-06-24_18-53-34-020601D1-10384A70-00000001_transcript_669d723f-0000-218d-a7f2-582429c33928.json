    "transcript_customer": "<CUSTOMER ts_27.72_c>: good afternoon Carrara my name is Luis Charles I'm a certified financial planner and on the phone with us I have Luis Charles and Pete's mother uh Luis Charles and we're calling because they're uh MaryAnn's husband uh Pete's father has an account\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_55.58_c>:  TIAA um he is currently uh experiencing some dementia and we had recently submitted uh on 2233-59-79 a durable power of attorney um document so we wanted to see if that was received and booked into the account so that we could um ask a couple questions that um that are going on\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_78.04_c>:  hmm well I think there are multiple uh like 5 4 others there's 6 0 5 4 separate plans so I guess\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_83.22_c>: let's see 0 was University W Luis University Alabama University\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_89.16_c>:  uh Luis Alabama uh Luis so yeah there's several\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_103.94_c>:  great okay yeah Marian's on the phone with us I am here yeah I did\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_121.26_c>:  it's a conference call so I'm not sure if she can hear us great Luis she uh the representative is asking if you could please tell her your address\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_128.68_c>:  give her glasses\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_140.28_c>:  thank you for 4 9179 Annapolis Alabama\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_142.68_c>:  42\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_145.02_c>:  637\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_147.76_c>:  Dash 0288\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_154.19_c>:  definitely yes\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_163.54_c>: um so Mr Charles uh Luis Charles is\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_164.75_c>:  uh\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_218.52_c>:  at a at a point where he's experiencing some um heavy medical expenses so we're we're at the point where um Luis and her son Luis are wanting to have access to the funds um so we were told that the the most aggressive withdrawal strategy or transfer strategy would be to engage in the the sort of the lifetime annuity payments which is still 0 or ten years or something to that regard um because they had already pulled out their required minimum distribution earlier this year um we were looking to just really roll have the first portion or have this done as as a rollover where it goes into their brokerage account their Ira accounts where they have a little bit more control over pulling the money out as needed\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_237.35_c>:  but uh when the forms were I guess prepared and when they processed it they issued um checks rather than a rollover so taxes were withheld um from it so we were looking to either have new new checks\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_239.48_c>: issued um\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_275.77_c>:  to to sort of um replenish them for the taxes that were withheld or maybe you know void out the checks that were sent um because they have not been cashed yet and issued new checks for the the full amount rather than uh the the the withholding that was done I'm sorry and the last representative we spoke with was going to go back and check I think his name was Luis was going to go back and check the phone conversation because we have a feeling that it was it was entered in correctly by him when he sent the paperwork as they pay off and not a rollover\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_297.31_c>:  yeah that's yeah Luis Charles Luis Charles was the last person we spoke to and to to Pete's Point yeah that was that was 6 of the things that he offered to us as a solution is to go back and sort of check the call history\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_309.45_c>:  and determine um you know if in fact it was just sort of a misunderstanding between what we were communicating in the way the forms were prepared for the dollars when they were sent\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_320.87_c>: yes yes\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_325.07_c>:  okay and what what is your name again I'm sorry\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_327.64_c>:  okay\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_331.61_c>:  okay all right thank you all right yep\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_740.22_c>: yes here yeah we're all still here\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_759.87_c>:  we're we're familiar I'm familiar\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_771.46_c>:  yeah I mean the the issue really is just the the the tax issue\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_873.26_c>: um you know because currently I mean that we have the checks um but taxes were withheld and you know for a rollover it's not a taxable event so is there a way to get another round of checks issued to compensate or to um you know sort of work out the tax issue that was withheld as we have to put the balance in to compensate for to put in the account correct Luis correct yeah as Luis we we spoke to this issue with their accountant and it was just sort of walking us through different options but his hope and our hope is that you know TIAA can somehow someway either you know cancel and reissue or issue new checks to account for what was withheld um but they didn't want withhold withheld\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_888.82_c>:  okay well what what are our options at this point\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_894.12_c>:  the representative\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_899.96_c>: I said the forms were filled out by the representative\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_904.03_c>:  at TIAA got them in time\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_916.3_c>:  correct but we didn't fill the forms out that was filled out on your end so that's what concerns me is if they were filled out incorrectly in the wrong box was checked\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_923.05_c>:  I didn't read to them I got them from Tia got them from Luis presented them to my dad and he signed them\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_932.71_c>:  so it just seems like it wasn't it wasn't filled out in the correct manner that we wanted it to and now we're being penalized for it\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_983.62_c>:  yeah I mean I swear you the previous representative that we spoke to about this issue uh his name is Luis Charles was this sort of RSSI he was saying like there's more options you know that you can go back and sort of check the recording from the initial call and he was saying that if it was an error on on their end we can you know make make it right or you know talk about just you know figure out ways to to help uh the the clients um for you know we don't want to expose them to taxes that they shouldn't have to pay\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1002.05_c>: it's already gonna go within our institution if you know if we if there was a misunderstanding and something was issued we have the ability to cancel out checks and issue new checks so I'm sure you guys have that same ability\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1016.52_c>:  um and I don't know procedurally what needs to be done but I'm sure there's something that can be done so whether it's you or you know the an operations person or you know a manager just has more experience or something just you know we want to I guess\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1023.75_c>:  see what we need to do to get this resolved for what's in the best interest of Mr Charles here in his family\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1044.74_c>:  yeah yeah we need to get the solution\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1053.54_c>:  okay\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1056.72_c>:  jeez\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1416.54_c>: it's\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1421.12_c>:  okay thank you\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1898.29_c>: yes we're here we're\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1903.73_c>:  thank you okay thank you\n\n<CUSTOMER ts_1907.01_c>: hello my name once again is Luis
